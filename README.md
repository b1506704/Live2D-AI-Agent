# Live2D-AI-Agent

**Developed by Anh Le**

Live2D-AI-Agent is a web application that enables users to interact with AI-powered virtual agents using Live2D models. The platform combines a React-based frontend for managing assets and interacting with agents, and a Python backend powered by Flask and transformer-based language models. It supports user asset management (uploading, previewing, downloading, and deleting), AI chat with customizable personalities, and seamless Live2D model integration.

## Features

- **Live2D Model Integration**: Load, preview, and interact with Live2D models directly in the browser.
- **AI Chat Agent**: Communicate with an AI agent running transformer models (e.g., Qwen3-1.7B) with customizable personalities and prompts.
- **Asset Management**: Upload, preview, download (single or bulk as ZIP), and delete assets (files, images, audio) with real-time progress and feedback.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Modern React frontend with asset search, pagination, and responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend API**: RESTful endpoints for chat, asset management, and static file serving.
- **Extensible**: Easily add new AI models, personalities, or asset types.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Pixi.js, Live2D Cubism SDK
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, Transformers (HuggingFace), Torch
- **Other**: Asset storage and handling, session management

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for frontend)
- Python 3.8+ (for backend)
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

#### Backend

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5000` (backend serves frontend by default).

### Usage

- **Asset Management**: Upload Live2D models, images, or audio. Use the Asset Manager to preview, download, or delete assets.
- **Chat with AI**: Interact with the Live2D agent using the chat interface. The agent supports file management intents (list, search, download, rename, delete) and natural conversation.
- **Live2D Interaction**: Select and load a model to animate and interact with.

## Project Structure

```
main.py                  # Flask backend, API, AI agent logic
/frontend                # React frontend
  /src
    /components          # UI components (e.g., AssetManager)
  index.html             # Entry point
/storage                 # User-uploaded assets
/models                  # AI model files
```

## Customization

- **AI Models**: Add or change models in `main.py` under `CHAT_MODELS`.
- **Personalities**: Define agent personalities and prompts for unique behaviors.
- **Assets**: Upload new Live2D models, images, or audio as needed.
